# postcount-service-project

Python service called "postcount-service". This simple application counts the POST requests which are made everytime the page is accessed. 
It maintains a web page with a counter for the number of POST requests it has served and return it for every GET request it gets.

The application uses python as its programming language which can be seen in postcount-service.py directory. 

### Steps for building and running the application 

When ready, start the application by running: 
`docker compose up --build`.

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080.

### Deploying the application to the cloud 

First, build your image, e.g.: `docker build -t myapp .`.
If your cloud uses a different CPU architecture than your development machine (e.g., you are on a Mac M1 and your cloud provider is amd64), you will want to build the image for that platform, e.g.:
`docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t myapp .`.

Then, push it to your registry, e.g. `docker push myregistry.com/myapp`.

Consult Docker's [getting started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/workshop/04_sharing_app/) docs for more detail on building and pushing.
